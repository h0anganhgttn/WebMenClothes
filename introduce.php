	To many men, the concept of fashion isn’t something that holds much importance or interest. This isn’t to say that these men dress poorly, but usually, the basis behind why a certain outfit might look good doesn’t register in their minds, and so a different end result is produced. While this isn’t necessarily a critique on a man’s ability to dress himself, it is an unfortunate side-effect of the gender norms that formulate the idea that fashion is a topic reserved for women, for whom clothing is more of an art than a tool.</br>
	Now, of course this idea isn’t universally true; in fact there has been a noticeable shift in the way young men handle their style. The evolution of streetwear and influence by hip-hop artists such as Kanye West have evoked a response in many, which falls hand in hand with sneaker-heads of any age. There are many “schools” of men’s fashion, such as the aforementioned streetwear scene, which encompasses a wide range of styles frequented by staple brands such as Supreme or Bathing Ape. When it comes down to it however, grouping style into specific categories such as streetwear detracts from what clothing is meant to be, which is an extension of the self.
